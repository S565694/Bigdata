## *Project Title*
Healthcare Cost Analysis and Prediction

## *Project Idea*
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting healthcare costs to support financial optimization in the healthcare sector. By leveraging patient demographics, medical treatments, and diagnosis data, the aim is to uncover trends, understand cost distributions, and identify high-cost drivers. A machine learning regression model will be developed to predict healthcare expenses based on patient profiles and medical history. Additionally, the project will highlight key cost segments for optimization and create interactive dashboards to visualize cost trends, distributions, and the primary factors influencing healthcare expenses, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.

## *Technology Summary*
- *Programming Languages*:  
  - Apache Spark for handling large healthcare datasets efficiently and performing data preprocessing and feature engineering.  
  - Python for scripting and analysis using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.

- *Machine Learning*:  
  - PySpark MLlib for distributed machine learning tasks on large datasets.

- *Data Visualization and Business Intelligence*:  
  - Tableau or Power BI for creating interactive dashboards to visualize cost distributions, trends, and high-cost segments.

- *Data Storage and Integration*:  
  - SQL for structured data storage and querying.

## *Architecture Summary*
1. *Data Source*: Collect data, including patient demographics, medical records, treatment histories, and cost data.  
2. *Data Processing*: Clean and preprocess data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering for deeper insights.  
3. *Data Storage*: Use SQL for structured storage and efficient querying.  
4. *Machine Learning*: Apply PySpark for building predictive models to estimate healthcare costs based on patient profiles.  
5. *Visualization*: Use Tableau or Power BI for creating interactive dashboards to showcase trends and insights.

## *Project Goals*
1. Visualize healthcare costs by hospital tiers and city tiers.  
2. Analyze monthly and annual cost trends.  
3. Map state-wise healthcare costs to identify regional cost disparities.  
4. Highlight high-cost patients and contributing factors.  
5. Provide actionable insights for cost optimization and financial planning.
